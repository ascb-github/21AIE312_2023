      "The Tile Open Gap Identification and Filter  System is an innovative system \n",
      "that uses advanced algorithms for image processing to identify and filter  out tiles \n",
      "with open gaps in real -time during the manufacturing process. This system is \n",
      "crucial in the construction industry, as open gaps between tile s can lead to \n",
      "significant problems such as water seepage, durability issues, and safety risks. \n",
      "The system's advantages include enhanced productivity, less waste, and better \n",
      "product quality. The system can also be customized to meet specific \n",
      "manufacturing n eeds, which can lead to even greater efficiency and cost savings. \n",
      "Overall, the Tile Open Gap Identification and Filter System is a ground -breaking \n",
      "innovation that has the potential to revolutionize the tile manufacturing industry.  \n",

      "Dept. of CSE, ASE, Bangalore  PROBLEM STATEMENT  \n",
      "The tile open gap identification and filler system project tries to show us the most \n",
      "common  issue of gaps or spaces that appear between tiles in flooring, walls, or any other \n",
      "applications. The creation of a system that recognizes  gaps and automa tically fills them with \n",
      "appropriate content is one suggested approach to solving this issue. In order to utilise the \n",
      "proper filler depending on the gap measurements and tile type, the system must reliably \n",
      "identify gaps of various sizes and shapes.  Addition ally, the system should be quick and \n",
      "inexpensive to run, reducing the time and labor  needed for upkeep and repairs. The \n",
      "recommended remedy should also put safety first, making sure that using the system won't \n",
      "endanger the user or the environment.  \n",
      " \n",
      "BACKGROU ND \n",
      "For flooring and wall coverings in residential and commercial structures, tiles are \n",
      "frequently employed. However, wear and tear and other causes over time may cause gaps \n",
      "to develop between the tiles. These spaces can be ugly and dangerous for tripping. These \n",
      "spaces have often been filled with tile fillers. These fillers might not be effective in moist or \n",
      "extremely small gaps, though. Additionally, manually filling in gaps can be labor -intensive  \n",
      "and time -consuming. Therefore, a system that can locate open  gaps and fill them effectively, \n",
      "regardless of their size or location, is required. The overall look and safety of tiled surfaces \n",
      "might be enhanced while saving time and effort.  \n",
